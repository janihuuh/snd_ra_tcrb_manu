## Biological characterization of patients with adult-onset aCCP-negative destructive rheumatoid arthritis
Code to reproduce the TCRb findings in Kelkka et al manuscript

## BACKGROUND: 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease targeting synovial joints. Traditionally, RA is divided into seropositive (SP) and seronegative (SN) disease forms, the latter consisting of an array of unrelated diseases with joint involvement. In addition to difficulties in assigning correct therapy to each patient group, suboptimal patient classification has contributed to underpowered scientific research. 

## OBJECTIVE: 
We studied an unusually severe and erosive form of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide negative (aCCP) RA (CND-RA). We sought biological characteristics to differentiate this rare but aggressive disease from early seropositive (SP-RA) and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (SN-RA). We also aimed to further establish the role of CD8+ lymphocytes and somatic mutations in autoimmune arthritis.

## METHODS AND RESULTS: 
T-cell receptor beta (TCRβ) deep repertoire sequencing revealed a unique TCR signature in CND-RA patients when compared to the other arthritis groups. Also, CND-RA patients expressed higher levels of the bone destruction-associated TNFSF14 cytokine and these patients’ IgG repertoire recognized significantly fewer endogenous proteins than did SP-RA patients’ repertoires. We detected a unique and stable mutation signature in a clonally expanded CD8+ cytotoxic effector T-cell clone and single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed a supercytotoxic gene expression signature within this cell population.

## CONCLUSIONS: 
CND-RA is a unique sub-class of RA as demonstrated by TCR repertoire and autoantibody profile analyses. We present data that support the disease modulatory role of CD8+ lymphocytes in CND-RA. Our results warrant further studies on the role of somatic mutations in chronic inflammation.
